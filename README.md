**PREDICTING BEHAVIOURAL CHALLENGES IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER**


The project entitled "Predicting Behavioral Challenges in Autism Spectrum Disorder" aims to utilize machine learning algorithms for the prediction of behavioral patterns in individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ASD is a complex neuro developmental condition characterized by a wide range of behavioral challenges and social communication difficulties. Understanding and predicting these behaviors are crucial for early intervention and tailored support strategies.


Comprehensive datasets containing a range of behavioral, demographic, and clinical data from people with ASD diagnoses will be gathered for this research. The preprocessing of these datasets will take care of any discrepancies and manage missing values as well as feature normalization. The preprocessed data will next be subjected to a variety of machine learning techniques, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree in order to create prediction models. These algorithms are trained to find patterns in the data and forecast possible behavioral issues that people with ASD might have.


Among the three algorithms, the Decision Tree algorithm excels in classification, offering optimal performance in predicting autism based on input features. Consequently, the Decision Tree algorithm was selected as the preferred choice.


**PROBLEM STATEMENT**


Unpredictable behaviors are a common feature of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), making early detection and management difficult. The whole range of actions may not be fully captured by traditional diagnostic techniques based on clinical observations. Therefore, in order to effectively forecast and comprehend the behaviors associated with ASD, more objective, data-based prediction methods are desperately needed. Without these resources, professionals and caregivers find it difficult to properly customize interventions, which impedes the growth and wellbeing of people with ASD.
